## Word Finder in Crossword Game

This Python program allows you to find words within a user-defined matrix. 

**Features:**

* Creates a matrix based on user input (number of rows and columns).
* Takes user input for the elements of the matrix.
* Finds a given word within the matrix, searching horizontally, vertically, and diagonally (including both directions).

**Instructions:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the `numpy` library using `pip install numpy`.
3. Run the script using `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different).
4. Follow the prompts to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
5. Enter the elements of the matrix row-wise.
6. The program will display the entered matrix.
7. Enter the words you want to search for. You can enter multiple words one by one.
8. The program will search for each word in the matrix and display the location (row, column, or diagonal) if found.

**Notes:**

* This program is designed for educational purposes and may not be optimized for large matrices.
* The program assumes the user enters valid integers for the number of rows and columns, and valid strings for the matrix elements and search words.

**Further Improvements:**

* Implement error handling for invalid user input.
* Improve search efficiency for larger matrices.
* Allow searching for patterns (regular expressions) instead of just whole words.

**Feel free to explore and modify this code as you see fit!**
